# discovery inbound - nothing on 6443/10250/12250, and nothing between worker nodes. That

# NSG for OCI *Network* Load Balancers, which is what a UDP Service gets: the classic Load
# Balancer behind oci-native-ingress-controller is TCP/HTTP only, so a Service asking for UDP
# has to be an NLB (oci.oraclecloud.com/load-balancer-type: "nlb"). wireguard is the reason
# this exists.
#
# Separate from the lb/lb_int NSGs because the protocol differs and because an NSG costs
# nothing until something attaches itself to it - a deployment without wireguard simply never
# references this one.
