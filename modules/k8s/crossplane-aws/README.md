## Opinionated helm package for crossplane ##

This module depends on: modules/k8s/crossplane-core

This will initialize the [AWS crossplane provider](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-aws/releases).

The Helm package is made up of 2 ArgoCD sync waves.



### Example code ###

```
    modules:
      - name: crossplane-aws
        source: crossplane-aws

```

### Cleanup job ###

A provider version bump re-fetches every provider package at once, and on a slow registry proxy some fetches are cut short by Crossplane's reconcile deadline. The ProviderRevision then reports Healthy with a truncated object list (crossplane/crossplane#7817), never takes control of the missing ManagedResourceDefinitions, and with SafeStart the provider stays scaled to zero. The `job.deleteInactiveProviderRevisions` / `job.restartOnInvalidProviderRevisions` Job (same script as in crossplane-core) is an ArgoCD PostSync hook, so it runs after every sync of this module: it waits for the roll to settle, restarts the `crossplane` deployment in `job.crossplaneNamespace` when an active ManagedResourceDefinition is not controlled by an Active ProviderRevision, and deletes the Inactive ProviderRevisions.

### Provider resources ###

All provider pods share the requests and limits in `providerResources.default` (`providerResources.family` for `upbound-provider-family-aws`); the defaults come from measured usage on the test clusters. To size one subpackage differently, add it under `providerResources.providers`; the given fields are deep-merged over `default` and that provider gets its own DeploymentRuntimeConfig. The chart ships memory request overrides for `ec2`, `mq` and `sqs`. Which providers are installed is still decided by `global.requiredProviders`, `global.extraProviders` and the observer settings.

```
providerResources:
  providers:
    ec2:
      requests:
        memory: 380Mi
```
